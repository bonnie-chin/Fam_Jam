## FAMJAM
FamJam is an Android app that helps families, roommates - **anyone who lives together**, to **get to know each other in a fun way.** Every “family member” will receive two daily missions and one mission weekly. The first daily mission will be sent in the morning while the second will appear at a **random time** for you to rack up bonus points, encourage you to put family first and of course to see you scramble. Every mission involves **brightening up someone's day** or doing something to get to **know another member better.** For example, your mission of the day might be to give your mom a hug! The weekly mission will involve the entire “family”, with anything from playing soccer together to having a **profound discussion about what family means to them.**
 
After completing a mission, you immediately **earn points**, the harder the mission, the more points you get! Complete more missions and you can climb to the top of the leaderboard 😎. At the end of the week, the member with the **most points wins a badge**. Badges can also be earned through other methods, just to keep members on their toes. But be **warned**, _there’s also a laziness badge._

The member with the most points by the end of the month receives a present from the other members. Though of course, **everyone's a winner when you’re strengthening genuine connections with those around you!**
